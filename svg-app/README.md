shapes-svg
==========

This is a retry of an earlier shape generation app.  This one uses SVG to show the shapes.

TODO
====
- test the shape controller
- rotate the evenly spaced shapes so that they are flat on top
- do some validation of the get parameters in shape controller
- display interior angle value
- display interior angle image
- Build a form on shape.htm that takes sidelength and numsides
- paramaterize the build shell script
- check code coverage and add the appropriate tests
- separate points generation from the shape class - shape is mathematical, not concerned with display
